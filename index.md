## Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails - Reading Group

Reading Group for NNT's "Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails".

### Organization

Weekly meetings and weekly readings will be held over Zoom.

| **Time**     | Wednesday, 8 pm MT                                                                         |

| **Location** | [https://ucalgary.zoom.us/j/2634212463](https://ucalgary.zoom.us/j/2634212463) (FatTailed) |

If you want to be added to the Signal channel, contact Bryce or David directly.

Meetings will be informal and discussion based. Either Bryce or David will bring
~3 points of discussion from the weeks reading focused on understanding the technicals,
relation to the real world, or contrast to Taleb's public appearances.

A digital copy of the book is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488).

### Readings

The first 10 chapters will be explored. If this bears fruit, the remaining chapters will be added at a later date.
